I used Adobe XD to create a prototype of a small temperature converter app. Using the prototype as a guide, I then wrote the HTML and CSS to match the protoype. Link to Adobe XD prototype https://xd.adobe.com/view/147dee67-3334-4b46-73e9-b57d7792ecba-624c/grid.

And finally, I wrote the JavaScript to add functionality.
